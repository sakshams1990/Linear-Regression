**Problem Statement** - The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs.

**Solution**

Linear Regression model is being developed using Sklearn.linear_model library.

Input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol. And the output variable (based on sensory data) is quality (score between 0 and 10).

**The RMSE of the train and set are  0.65 and 0.63 respectively**
